## Overview
EZMealPlan is a CLI-based system that helps users to plan their meals. Users can view a list of pre-created meals in the main
recipes list, filter them by meal name, ingredients and cost according to their personal preferences, and add them into their personal wishlist.
Additionally, users have the ability to add their own recipes to the main recipes list and remove meals from both their personal wishlist and the recipes list.
